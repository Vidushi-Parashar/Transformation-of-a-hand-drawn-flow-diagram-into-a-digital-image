# Transformation-of-a-hand-drawn-flow-diagram-into-a-digital-image
The goal of this project is to apply the concepts of perceptual grouping to digitize hand-drawn flow diagrams and render an aestheticized image made of polygons and connectors. We address typical imperfections in human drawing such as missed intersections of lines, overshooting of lines beyond the intersection point and curved line segments. Our method works on camera acquired images of flow diagrams and is able to handle illumination variations, shadows and speckle noise in the input. In this project, we describe an algorithm to recognize all the types of polygons connected through lines. We have tried to redress many human errors and background noises. Moreover, we have digitalized hand written text and placed them into their respective positions. The scope of this algorithm is not only hand drawn flow diagrams, but it can also be modified to extend its application to architectural drawings, circuit diagrams, or may be a toddler friendly application to help them learn about polygonal shapes.
